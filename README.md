# obtuse-conversion
Takes arbitrary dimensional quantities, returns obtuse but equivalent SI unit combinations with robust user tunability. (e.g. 5km --> 0.005 microwatt-tesla-petasieverts per nanohertz-squared-zettanewton-ohm-ampere)
Don't take my word for it, plug results into wolfram alpha (some reformatting required).
