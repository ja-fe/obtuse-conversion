# obtuse-conversion
Twitter bot (@obtuse_units) which replies to mentions with the summoning text, converting units to equivalent but obtuse SI combinations.
Core conversion function is very tunable and robust.

E.g. "Just ran 3.107 miles!" --> "Just ran 500000000 petacoulomb-attowebers per hectonewton-second!"
